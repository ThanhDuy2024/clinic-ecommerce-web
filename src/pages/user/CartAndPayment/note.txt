                          address (city),
                          address (street)
                          address (commune),
                          address (number house),
                          type of services (choose from the list),
                           type of sub-services (choose from the list),
                          time booking,
                          date booking,
                          reason,
                          cost and payment (only paying at the medical facility),
                          warning (if you need),
                          submit button
      In fact, we actully choose the department first, doctor and time then.
      But if patient does not know or choose someone, they can use this form to create quickly and randomly doctor.
